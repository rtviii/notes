A hundred and a hundred times have i taken up my lantern, seeking at high noon.
- somewhere in the L'histoire de la folie

# Гастрит

приючу собаку.
как прижевется -- задушу суку,
как от ошибок любви полюбил разлуку.

пришла осень.
перестал считать сигареты.
не спорю с мамой, не гадаю где ты.

перееду в европу,
обратно. т.е. опять куда-то. зачем-то
я ведь всё твердил, что я "с континента".

вазоконстрикция.
сужение кровеносных сосудов.
выражаясь проще -- "порется там где худо".

будущее это место
где становится пусто.
я забываю всё, чего нет y Пруста.

на весах -- всё:
детство, рак, мамин сонный профиль,
дни безделья. сбритая щетина, спазм эпохи.

# How to roll a cigarette

Hoisted into position
on the nondescript foursquare porch,
middle of nowhere-america,
every time of year,
perpetual end of history,
the evermorning night.
just outside.
the fence that's never locked, spotty hedgerow, flapping bugscreen.
all -- little punctures in the membrane that separates homeostasis from ruin.

Passinonately same as other men,
loyal as much to the momentary vacancy of mind as to the habit that moves them.
Pressure systems tread the prairie, breath leafs in and out of alleys.
The great collective meditation on the vortex of brown foliage.
Somewhere on the inside a Kharybdis hole widens into which thoughts dissappear:

"Was she -- my brightest zenith?" The twilight habits develop.
"Last OCB filter." Must i survey the ashtray again?
"My body feels different than last year." A morbid index.
Is there still enough tail left to bite? Good. Good...

Emberflakes meander, pavement-bound
radioactive snow.
The milky echo of the esophagus props up the air.
Thoughts cast up for inspiration will bounce off the invisible ceiling.

Hypochodria nursed in the soft warm clay of neuroses.
"Shhhh shh, it's alright.
Nobody has to see,
noone has to know,
no opinions needs to be held at all.
You are almost old news now, sport.
Still breathing, but already a fossil."

# Breakup

Memory needs to decompose. Like a house in Pripyat or an unlikely campsite in the woods. The paint has to peel and reveal cement, the wolves and does and thrushes need to habituate to alien geometry now perched at the edge of their forest, still imposing but already immobile.
The patch of ground that once cradled a body now demands the passing of seasons: rain, foliage and snow.
Space, molting out of hints of former presence, mind abandoning words. Tokens and memorabilia dispersed among mutual friends. Erased footprints and shoots of weed where a shelter's shadows used to drop.
Excision of the heart, blanched bone, the smoothed contour of trampled grass. Reminders of any intent erased away and one does not feel that one is leaving something behind or passing something by, because there is nothing there.

# Some more bitching

The world I'm tossed out into is a pencil sketch of the one we had inhabited.
Mind spends hours rubbing the seashells i brought back with me,
the souvenirs i wasn't foolish enough even then to not collect
They too will flake and disintegrate.

You are forever out of reach and i hate what you did to me,
I hate the autumn outside and the tension in the neck.

A chorus of reminders, a cluster of voices stretching over the city.
They sing praise to the gravity and meaning of that bygone world.
They are the aftermath of love, the shellshock, anterograde amnesia that forbids a certain future.
Now there is only flirting with louder noise or basking in stupified silence.

"god bless you on your way, you innocent children. do your exploration and play and indulgent loving so long as you hurt no one and your conscience is clear."
This couldn't really work even if i could push the words out of my throat.

# To the prostitute

Remind me to bring kitty treats and probiotics next time we're at the canyon
temple.
Last time we went -- the grove of the sweetest fruit, remember?
To get there:
- trace the tiger-marks at the foot of the holy wall
- keep climbing, a little past paradise.

# Lazy lazy

I am able to treat my disease but
the botanist in me stays the hand: how rare this bloom.
The vintner in me guesses: how sweet the wine
of inaction.
And the wanderer in me aches to know:
how hot the sun
over the roads that I’ll crawl once this weed
has burrowed through
the carcass of my hopes
and made host of my body
and soil of my nerves.


[8 Apr 2024 02:10:18]

i want to be able to help my mother, because it is good
i want to feel alive again: the depth of the moment available to the child
i'm not being a child these days: just a vacant mind
i want to play games with other boys, i don't want to be left behind. I'm leaving myself behind. You don't have to kill, but you must play
i want to make music, i want my body to be healthy

# Undated

I'm a ball of twine strewn up and down the street,
i cling to people's feet and stifle chestnut branches.
That is how i travel the city.

now i am the speartip, impetus of tempered steel. all paths exist within me.
now i am a soft fruit, a tender apricot. the lips of a fat lady part my flesh from
the stone while she talks. This is how the days pass.

i'm the city, scattered over the land,
i am its young and old not seeing each other.
i'm the beggar who makes his way from the railway station to the courthouse every morning,
i'm the opening of the unknown composers' latest piece
and the girl who swoons in the arms of a man who doesn't love her.
these are the things i have eyes for.

im the caravan, lost in the Afghan heat,
hundreds of years ago, the mule and the tick
how long can i go on? how far to stretch?
i'm god's grace that never arrives
and the night that soothes the desert.

пусть этот день и искажён гримасой боли
во влажных сумерках его нас ждёт и дом, и свят

век гонит по земле народы, метрополис пестрит чалмой.

Я снова квартирант на перекрёстке,
и четверть века привыкаю быть собой.

# You did it to yourself, yes siree

Tea poisons the water, diffuses like fog over land.
My skin is dry, my eyes and throat are full of sand and my lungs are in throngs of a dying sun.

Pinned to the face of clock, in perfect plane with the motion of its arms,
Unable to witness any single moment but conscious of their caravan passing.

Condemned to be still when the spring moves, unable to follow.
Spun maniacally when the flock rests, severed from communion.

Артем Эдуардович, [25 Jun 2024 06:22:40]

All you false friends — you are not welcome to my pancakes anymore,
it's me and the homeless guy at sev who owns me 20 000 cigarettes against the world.

Артем Эдуардович, [27 Jun 2024 03:12:16]

The smells you share on your shirt and on your ivory collarbone is God teaching me the meaning of “summer” again, my mind a slate while I have your gaze. I feel good when I find the crooked smile in the field of freckles. Would it that I were reckless and climbed the next fence south.

Артем Эдуардович, [25 Aug 2024 20:16:01]

I have to stop acting like a hard guy

Spreading ash in the back alleys

Артем Эдуардович, [27 Sep 2024 00:59:00]

If someone doesn’t lend me a hand soon I’ll be the first one to go out
All these baubles and puzzles and toys, just to fill the emptiness

Артем Эдуардович, [4 Oct 2024 13:58:59]

an insufficient work of love

Артем Эдуардович, [6 Oct 2024 22:40:58]

Important words slipped my tongue today : nobody’s going to help me. Time to save yourself.
