> It was strangely painful and frightening to me then, but now that i'm out of it, i remember that everything just trivially made sense, without any wonderous quality to it. Perhaps because one is desensitized to wonder by the experience of rebirth. Hence the lack of differential preference. None of the things you did with your time was unlike the other in the end. Out of this -- a great despair is borne and ultimately a motivation to defy the end. This is the urge that i seem to embody in 2020.

I dreamt of a world infinitely isomorphic. In my dream, my mother was a deepest source of vexation and fear for me: her presence was a constant reminder of the chasm of no-time whence I have once emerged and where my apprehension of myself might again disappear.

The pillars of my temple are the columns of my tomb. I throw fists at the unattainable ceiling with defiance of a convict forever condemned. In my powerlessness I gaze upward.

I guess it's something like this: the projection of sensory processes onto the tools of expression: perhaps it is useful to also consider music, body, dance, continuous motion of any sort as proto-semantics. But given all of those, is there anything about myself that i still can't represent?  My heart's been bothering me lately. Perhaps i'll know soon enough. I set foot on the bridge from the pristine temple of the conscious to the muck of the ANS.

This is the last light bulb I have. I just moved into this house. October caught me stoned in my room on the second floor of a house among other houses like this one in the country of lawns and recycling bins. This is my last light bulb, every now and then my mind wanders over to the time when I’ll be sitting one of these October or November… or December nights and try to solicit myself into practicing and the old lamp will suddenly close its faithful eye with a wolphramic snap.

The universal aspiration: to constitute the most persistent pattern. That’s why it always was and always will be: only us to begin with, only us to end with, and always us all over again.
Insofar as you are trying to achieve higher distance from your sensory experiences and impulses with “the long term in mind”, the hallmark of a universal messiah, you are what they call an Ego and all you are doing, as capably as you are endowed, is trying to expand yourself. The (hopefully) useful distinction i want to try and draw is between trying to expand horizontally by invading attention of others and filling up the room like hot air, an alternative -- enmesh yourself in and around others, sprawling through the cracks like hyphae.
Big ego refers to the preoccupation with the “evolutionary” success of one’s own pattern. Viral code competing with other code.

Inherent entropic dynamic of the animate conscious -- the inverse of the inanimate :whereas the classically -entropic systems tend towards  disorder, the mechanism of our minds is the reverse--  confusion decays into knowledge, certainty. The inherent urge to organize, preserve,  delineate,  expand, consume , conquer and master, clarify and elucidate, articulate and structure, control and command is the metric by which to measure  the ego. Its inflation might yet prove to be among the most unifying and fundamental dynamics of the universe, “so long as  we overcome the present”. Let Watts laugh. Borne as it might have been out of scarcity management (sensory information being the primary resource), the implications are terrifying now that the material has been mostly conquered. We are building the tools that would compensate for our inability to represent ourselves in full.
Perhaps it's always been so. And perhaps it's a just a curious choice that this particular species leans towards. Either way, universe is about to get pulled through its navel and out into the next beyond. A curious development indeed.

So what if it ( *ego* ) is just another inevitable motif in the tapestriy? That still signals individuality -- albeit not yours and yours alone, but of the whole thing, which you are anyways – so why struggle?
Egos are this  tapestry's sketches of the next tapestry. One of these eddies might prove to be the sink.

A fact: i am now at a place where i am afraid of being alone with myself. Falling asleep is hard. I am hypervigilant, scanning my chest with my mind for odd heartbeats and chest pains and sure enough, they appear. Thinking up all sorts of tingling and cancers and heart strokes. Running out into the night, heart-racing, unable to calm down. Dark place. Perhaps i need to seek psychological help.

No regard for the particulars, no preoccupation with local order, is what my I tends towards. There is potential for a vaster thing here, i believe. Painfully aware of its own evanescence, propelled by it, in fact. I've been terrified long enough. Now… to being terrifying?

		In a world beyond physicality to which we are departing, the morality from which we are departing is an artifact to examine and scrutinize, signalling your apprehnsion threafter, not something to enact. In fact, i have to remind myself sometimes: it's the other way around. Actions atributable to an agent were to be judged by the group, the value-schema came to be known as morality. In the world of delayed response, hidden confounders, externalities, anonimity and outsourced harm morality is an anthropological concept. The chasm is ravenous and growing, but it is not between the moral and the immoral, but between the conceivable and the general ability to conceive, the range of avaialable experiences and what they condition in men. Hence the disparity.

Met Farzad right about here, I guess. Not so sure about this anymore.

Roughly three degrees of functional mastery to a mathematical concept: naive pattern-matching, local apprehension, global pattern-recognition. Should probably stick to local apprehension for most things at school for time's sake.
The nature of metaphor, i still hope, is something beyond statistical extrapolation and curve fitting. The moment of the “leap” from pattern-matching to generalization is to be inspected from all angles.

*Program-synthesis. Program synthesis, as Francois Chollet puts it, has – will have -- more to do with the organic than with programming per se in my mind. Since the field is already leaning towards the stochastic, pseudo-continuous, noise-weaponizing “antifragile” techniques. Since the metaphor of the 'biological” seems to pay off, at least for now, it seems plausible if naive to indulge it further.Why does this seem useful? Because organisms, function-forms of the organisms, really, seem to all be approximate “solutions” to some environmental matrix. I have said this before, but this “grows” on me. If the branches of a tree and the spirals of a seashell and the petals of a rose seem platitudes and don't evoke useful contemplation anymore, take the example of rapid adaptation in the context of lateral gene transfer in prokaryotes. Bacterial aptittude for recombination finds a solution to the current space of viral stressors in the matter of hours, at a blink of an eye, basically and the penetration of that new form by the next set of viral vectors happens as quickly. The amount of of possible states, proportions and compositions cycled through daily is enormous.*

I'm sure that most of our mistakes, externalities to our actions – in the grand scheme of things result from imperfect representations. That is to say, when the formulation of the task itself or the formulation of our solution to the task fail to account for all the mutually dependent variables involved, there is going to be some long-term mismanagement\information-leaks even if in the short term it might appear to be solved.
Mathematics is something super-linguistic in a sense that its notions are more information-rich than the regular language in the Shannon sense. It speaks to what can be engineered, controlled, conceived of and apprehended completely because it suffers no redundancy – all the noise is “put to use” . It is the language of will-imposition: “if you know you can get it then you already got it and there is no other way it can be other than the way you know it to be. It's “effort in denoising in exchange for being sure”. The trade-off is sparsity – the number of operators is limited and they can only be applied to highly specific classes aka there are no perfect circles in the real world.
Wanted to share this before i forget  the little chat at the summit. The first 3 minutes of this thing is why i mentioned paul desmond at all. I know the "jazz greats"  very superficially, but i felt very strongly about your analogy between charlie parker's and trane's  styles being sort of like "ways of thinking" a la "i'd like to think the way charlie parker plays".
My couchsurfer was telling me the day before our hike about "icaros", the chants\songs that the shamans sing to the people undergoing the ayahuasca ceremony. That's fine, more hippie nonsense, right, but what i didn't know is that they also weave an "icaro", a song, into a carpet or a garment. Like a tapestry pattern or a mandala. So, again, a musical notation of sorts -- except asymbolic. It clicked better for me when jamie agreed that its a "projection of the same thing onto two mediums": the auditory, the visual.
So maybe if i were to try to get to my conception of "personality", not “ego”, let's say -- in terms of your words about Charlie Parker, it would be this way:
I mentioned it on our little run, but it seems that there is more than “just math” to music at high level of proficiency music because of its quasi-linguistic structure. Like.. if you look at the diversity of semanticsthat humans use in non-digital communication, regular language being just one in many, all of them fall within the “sensory range” or have to deal with external senses. From one's mother tongue out to all the foreign languages, to sign and braille, to color-coded buttons to arrows on the road signs, to the more embodied Semaphore patterns, hand gestures accompanying everyday conversations to almost universally recognizable motions like winking, thumbs-up and pointing, to all of the space of dance,visual art and music, to all flavors of yollering and hollering and “mehs” and “ahs”and “ohs”, facial expressions, you get it.

	It's obvious that these are all information-encoding modes. The sparsity of each depends on the degrees of freedom a given sense allows: you can't point to “salty”, but you can “say” it in sign language and likewise -- perhaps, you can't describe the fractal shape of the tree branches in sign, but you can draw it. Can't precisely draw how a bird sounds, but can reproduce it with your vocal cords. Can't specify the complex pirouet of a dancer with your voice or language, but can show it with your own body; perhaps certain things are best “said” with one's facial expression etc.
	In this way, i think, the whole of what we can conceive of and communicate is defined by the intersection of all these semantic schemas (ill or well defined as they might be) and everything outside of it is Godel's territory in that it can hardly be represented and therefore grasped. Sort of where one starts to feel the mental cocoon\ceiling.
	That's also why it makes sense to me to exclude algorithmized encodings from this set even though those are perfectly valid languages: these frequently fall outside human sensory range, which is precisely the reason they are useful, i guess, removed as they might be from our “native” representations. this is, actually, where it all tends in time – what AGI and“plugging ourselves into the grid” will come to mean: drastically extending\expanding the space of representations available to the human... mind? Ego?

Was pretty cool to hear Oriol Vinyalis recently talking about this precisely: https://youtu.be/Kedt2or9xlo?t=4764. Yoshoa Bengio has some very interesting things to say about this sort of mappings as well – as to what gets assigned a signifier and what doesn't, but i couldn't find the source unfortunately.

	To bring it back to music though – i think the reason sound is so compelling to humans as a semantic is that it hits the sweet-spot between manipulability and sparisty: the degrees of freedom are virtually unlimited with just frequency and rhythm – allows for continuous and discrete mappings at the same time; the delivery is instant, most folks can do it and everyone gets it. They say music is the universal language you know, but it's probably that language is the universal music in that the formal languages are finite subsets of musical expressions and instrumental music “reaches in between” the words.

By the same token, the musicians that have acquired absolute proficiency with their instrument can “articulate” virtually anything on it. That's sort of what  “jazz” came to mean for me recently: to trivialize it a bit – for people who are not into it, this music might seem formless and chaotic, but really, it's the ability to create almost any form that the player can conceive of on the canvas of frequency and tempo, wiggly air. And so perhaps some forms, perhaps, become a bit harded to apprehend if you don't have “the entry point” of experience with something related or adjacent in the representation space. Like in that distill activation-atlasses paper they give the examples of input patterns excite a given the most and then the cross-activation examples for multiple neurons at the time. For me, when jazz music seems arcane from time to time, i think it's because people who are playing it are so proficient that they are just able to layer these signifiers – chords/notes/melodies/harmonies/tempos/what-have-you faster and denser than you are able to apprehend it and so the message again starts to fall outside of your sensory range. I can't say i particularly “love” this, but i think this little piece of trane going to work showcases it very nicely, where he starts off with a barely recognizable motif of “my favorite things” and then quickly takes it outside of this world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as1rTILOZDQ . Everything sounds ecstatic and psychodelic as heck.
	So in that sense, i feel  like it is unsurprising that the expression of the personality of such players – like Trane, like Charlie for example – is amplified and their “contours” become more apparent because every minute impulse and sensory event in them (in theory) gets mapped to some part of the composition, whereas this is harder to discern in the more discrete machinery of language. (Human voice intonations notwithstanding): language is to music what mathematics is to language.
I heard Ian Goodfellow mention somewhere that the next big leap for representation-learning is multi-modal inputs: because even though the big data that we feed the networks right now is indeed very big, as a rule, it is homogenous(I don't mean the number of inputs, more the “datatype” for lack of a better word). Say, agents that are able to interpret and integrate multiple modes of input like frequency, pitch, language and let's say some biomarkers to go with it, will have a more organic representation space for NLP, i think. I'm not sure how to tranlate it into convolutional or recurrent terms – maybe there is one regular network for every mode of input and one nexus-network that integrates the inputs of those. Because, really, what words map to and from are not conditional probabilities, it's more like amygdala-encoded biomarkers{state}, tools{object} and hope\intent{request}.


Document the recent synchronicities: Jamie and his DMT quest, Aksel the other Strange Loop, pretty much everything Farzad, Fabio's keynote.
Synchronicities no more – perhaps my field of awareness grew somewhat to encompass these things too, but the number of new ideas that dominate the collective unconscious is becoming more singular with each year. The invisible sift of the self-reinforcing algorithms has been at play since the bit was defined, then, since Maxwell, perhaps since the first reflexive twitch of a spineless thing in the muddy backpond and on, to whatever else defined the differential in the oceanic soup. There is nothing else than this path for us, there never could have been. An ever-latent glimpse beyond the Godel-ceiling forever beckons, so slightly outside the envelope.
The imagination of men is converging on the ineffable vision of the world other than the one of which they are borne. As it has always been, i guess. But never so terminal a departure, never so frenzied at the door.


















Is that to be taken literally, or ideally, ... as in a cross-modal machine cooking cancer cure out of lamb ragout

With regards to the bit on multi- or cross-modal inputs, i wanna refer to “grounded language learning” that he(yoshua) mentions wherein the rl agent simultaneouly learns about the signifiers and and their physical attributes (however these might be represented) with some amount of supervision or even some pre-injected label, a proto-semantic so it's not complete Babylon.https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08272
My sense is that every unique modality (again, taking whats close to home: natural language and oh, tactility-touch, let's say) allows for unique mappings. From events\phenomena in “the-real-whatever-that-is-world” to their representations.
So, you know, to define one mystical in terms of the other mystical, let's say whatever exists or goes on in “the world outside” is “the meaning” and we can only get so much of it through our sensory organs, that each provides a different story – encodes a different slice of the that “real world” ting. So, like... the neurons in the visual cortex and the sensory neurons from the pinch fingers might ultimately be parsed at the same thalamus in the body and feed some of the same concepts, signifiers, “words” like “a cup”, “pour” and “steaming”, but the data incoming from the sensors and the sensor's architechture need not be the same.
I'm not going to press the neuron analogy much furhter because im sure there is fuckton of biomagnetism and emergence at every train stop involved, but i guess that i'm trying to make a case for somehow differentiating between different input types from different structures in the brain... or in a “multi-modal” network for that matter.
The biggest problem i see with this argument is that when taken at face value, it's still “just neurons firing, dude” and no matter in which configuration that happens, ultimately, it's still sequence to sequence. But i wonder if that's true.
Or at least i wonder what Ian Goodfellow means here [ https://youtu.be/Z6rxFNMGdn0?t=2126 ] and here [ https://youtu.be/Z6rxFNMGdn0?t=490 ].
Even though it nominally seems like “the same network”, the nervous system, in actuality i feel it's more like discrete modules feeding into a compiler switchboard with a logistics module on top.
So i guess, what i mean in yoshua's terms is that it makes sense to  “ground” natural language in (ideally) a few datatypes which are learnt in parallel, “jointly”.
Just a hunch from how the physical experience engenders the linguistic, to be honest, with the terms and metaphors people use to describe abstract concepts often carrying physical and spatial connotations. “smooth player” – efficiency of motion, “lofty concept” -- too massive or unwieldy to “pick up”, “stretched out too thin” -- lack of redundancy over a space of tasks.
With regards to the program-synthesis: i've heard a few people mention it now and yeah from what it sounds like, cancer-cure from ragout would fall into some extreme of this category. Searching over the subset of possible programs to fit a predefined evaluation criteria. Here is somebody doing this with assembly code, actually https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eschkufz/docs/thesis.pdf. In my cancerless-ragout world, i definitely see this applied to genetic logic gates or at least used to facilitate the search over transcription sequences when bio-bros are designing their designs – maybe it doens't even need to constitue a viable species or independent organisms as long as the environment(input) is engineered and maintained, just a feasible nucleotide transformation. Francois Chollet has this very pretty example of uncrumpling a ball of crumpled paper, edge by edge, until you get a  smooth sheet, except here maybe it's uncrumpling a system of gradients and cross-activations embedded in a progenitor-cell's genome.
 Idk man, jokes on me, of course, blessed ignorant lad, no 9-5 havent lost the “magic-machine” glitter yet maybe, but even given that it this all is bullshit i can't help but feel tha something big and terrible begins to stir in the world. Maybe im part of the problem and this hype-induced tunnel-vision is as much an inequality issue as anything else, but it's to be honest these vain visions of grandeur have been here in one form or another as long as i can remember myself, long before anything related to technology entered life, and i don't see it dispelled by any amount of grind either, to be frank, in fact i'm sure that it's going to exacerbate and that the opneai dudes are drunk off themselves and the potential they have at their fingertips, whether it will “benefit all of humanity equally” or otherwise... A few good actors/egomaniacs who can game the funding Game at the wheel again or what.. What do you think, dawg? Tell me straight. I'm actually pretty touched by a similar dynamic between this prof who invited me here, who's actually turning out to be a pretty inflated asshole himself, and this masters students on the team who's licking his ass. All sorts of fucking sleaziness and unspoken politics in how they run things here, honestly. And you'd think academia, medtech for christ's sake, i was so stoked to get out of Vancouver for a bit. Nope, still apes in drapes.

Chasing “the flavor of shattering the grand delusion”, the ultimate thrill, on a quest for stimulation, as ever, is it meaningful to ask whether it can be different? But you know it can.

In the bosom of one morality, there is always a seed of the next. Like language, like science, the episteme, the super-sensitive matrix of trends. It pays to be agnostic about the value of certain inhibitions – amoral – especially if they are isomorphic to the current perceived models of the world.

My brightest friend told me today that the only chance we have is plugging ourselves in. A field of poplar fluff, spores in the wind, hydrocephalus, virome and biome: even in this age of digital technological hysteria, the information-processing supremacy of organic systems, of life itself is indubitable. Perhaps because of the Godel bound that we are clawing at is not the cap of “information-processing” but of something else. Just a go-to metaphor in the time of accessible metaphors, as Y. Harari managed to conceive.  Perhaps it’s as it’s always been, the urge to persist, defiance of form. And yeah perhaps I’m just a little too existentially bothered.
Still, even though the body is but a shell, there is no getting rid of the ghost, you hope. I don’t see how and why would the first person unaffected by senescence want to relinquish their will to the last collective grid. Folks are just too eager to see and reach further, to soar higher and conceive grander.

Obviously, joint NLP learning of text and code for supervised program synthesis.
Easing back into the frame of the mundane unperturbed human mind has to be one of the most  subtle and reassuring feelings I have experienced. Throwing a glance at the periphery every few second to reassure it’s still accessible to perception and I’m not sinking into myself again. What a thrill to experience the mundane again.

Farzad:
After that blood-swell to the head incident which has been afflicting me for the last few weeks, I started noticing a definite increase in dizziness and absent-mindedness that comes after every meal, even though my overall worrying has been on decline and skipping breakfast helps. But it’s actually been a pretty uncertain battle of the last week and half to convince myself that whatever might have happened to me is not going to affect me in the long run and I’m getting better and just need to watch my shit and be positive about it.
 So, in this vein, though still feeling the diffusion of attention that accompanies my blood-sugar spikes, I have just pressed on and decidedly devoured two pains au chocolat with my latte for breakfast and told myself: “if this doesn’t kill you, nothing will”. I would like to report a beautiful Sunday in the old town of Lausanne . God is great. Coffee is expensive.

		The mounting impossibility of apprehension of the scope and detail of the human enterprise as a whole by a single human...
		Like shoots of mold that wither away from the mother node, there is only so far we are able to venture away from the nourishing well of our biological youth. I wonder if the capacity of the human mind, the ultimate feats of the nervous system, bounded as it is, are still veiled by the limit of the human body more mortal and imperfect yet...





Yeah, I think that’s almost exactly it, except maybe he is also making the case that that novelty is prophylactic in that our routine “patterns of thinking” actually tend towards similarity unless something shakes the ball up: routines become habits, same bus every morning, mannerisms take root etc. Like naïve ml models, we become the less able to generalize the more homogenous the data/experience is. Goes on to say that thus REM sleep is a necessary mechanism and fiction is like a conscious attempt on man’s part to replicate it[mechanism]. I think it’s sort of ruthlessly general towards all of the things fiction and doesn’t “explain it away” or anything, but sounds correct. Definitely gotta draw some sort of line between fiction and art there, probably where articulation, semantics come in.


[http://nautil.us/issue/77/underworlds/the-dreams-of-the-man-who-discovered-neurons] Ramon y Cajal tracking down logical inconsistencies in his osteology-lecture-gone-awry dream:
(i)	“Imperiously demanding that a 77-year-old retiree lecture on osteology”,
(ii)	” Neither poor health nor lack of time to prepare occurring to me as possible excuses”,
(iii)	” Forgetting things that I knew; when I wake up, I recite the carpal and tarsal bones from memory without mistakes”
So the prior against which he assesses his “dreaming self” is his “waking self”. Why is that not obvious to me? Because I’m in possession of intuitions that sprung from his work. Still needs articulation.



How is inarticulate different from asemantic, asymbolic?


On the reconstitution of ego post-trauma or post-trip… The structural integrity of the persona that has been reconstituted is not so much of interest as the reconstituting function: the parts of the CNS whose functional signature remains unperturbed throughout the trip might contain among them a coercive mechanism which, when the agonist is no longer present, restores the attractor-structure of self-awareness.
That is, even though the sensory input is largely or entirely scrambled, some vital parameters – perhaps in the ANS – remain untouched which coerce the system back into stability and recursion. Ah the haunting glimpses of periphery.
Perhaps it is these areas/modules (the transformations that they represent on their I/O) that should be sought out and incorporated into information-processing mechanisms that could benefit from self-attention.

Things felt like trying to grasp onto a handful of sand. Mind had to assume the diligence of a beggar, fists ceded to cupped hands.

What I, along with most people, have in limited supply is not the aptness for symbolic manipulation, but the discipline to separate and confidence to bind subliminal concepts to a semantic.
Physiologically, the semblance of grasp on an operator is acquired in the same way one lands on his feet after having committed to the first somersault. An intuition is the confidence of having had spun through a thousand.

What i've thus far considered nimbleness and motility starts to resemble faulty breaks, impulsiveness and lack of focus. There was a conviction here once that divergent thinking and positive escapism marks the explorer, is the only path to the untrodden. There is little but a confused neurosis in its place now. In fact, whatever was in this place before, could not have been *conviction*. The great purge is at hand.

найду -- и настанет другая эра.
где-то здесь коридор из заката в ночь,
на исходе век полумеры.

	There is no culture without a tomb and no tomb without a culture; in the
	end the tomb is the first and only cultural symbol. The above-ground tomb
	does not have to be invented. It is the pile of stones in which the victim of
	unanimous stoning is buried. It is the first pyramid.

	A) supply chain efficiencies enabled low-cost production of lifestyle goods, and
	B) participation in these lifestyles and microcultures also moved online. Both made lifestyles hyper visible.

	Under quarantine conditions, there is less opportunity to physically signal one’s participation in a culture, so clothing and conspicuous consumption matter less.

If i can speak honestly, without deceiving myself too much, to some part of my eschatology, it is the escapist, flow-defying urge to overcome the current. It engenders both sprawling breadth and fundamental incompleteness.
I have to achieve the vertical now that i have a grip on the horizontal.

Such mechanistic biological explanations for why we might observe these differences in 429effectivenessare in line with the theoretical reasoning that biological systems need to resolve the 430paradox they face at individual scales and therefore construct multi-scale structure. We seek totie 431the “certainty paradox” directly to the notion of scalein biological systemsand provide a means 432for researchers to reduce the “black box” nature of these systems by searching across scales for 433models with low uncertainty.Understanding the mechanics of information transfer and noise in 434biologicalsystems,and howthey affectfunctionality, remainsamajor challengein biology today.435Onecan imaginethatthedrivefromunicellular to multicellular lifewasbased on someformof 436similar trade-offs, asthosebetween prokaryotesand eukaryotes,thatallowed multicellular lifeto 437operateviaeffectivemacro-stateswhilereserving apoolof noiseand degeneracy.

Hyperpsychoses,
fireflies penetrate the boundless night
a pillar of fire
female voices spin
gaunt fingers run ribcage harpstrings
saliva drips from maw of night
it lusts enraptured


excruciating grimacing in lonely corridoors unpeels false skin.
an inward sieve, it refines a frantic dance into a sentient non-motion,
frothing ecstasy to silent quivering.

a mortal furnace burns, breath locomotive
canvas-piercing sentience in utterance manifest,
juggernaut of will.
life, a world pulling itself out of its navel,
still not a hint in the windswept sand.
i, a source and burden to my upward gaze,
i seethe with ritual.
i move until indifference presides over the effaced contours of pain,
until i'm once more unware.

...

curiosty is neither pruned nor dulled,
assumes the shape of vine, root
it pokes and abandons, childlike.

Sustained intensity: the thin sliver between the banal and the absurd must get thinner.

Bending into a complete epochal gesture.
Terrible force comes in soft footsteps.

Universe brimming with luminous truth, beckons us.
In meteor impetus forever burn, foreverlast, youth.

Of paths: one of no terminus, one i must utter,
We'll have the starry sky, and not the starry gutter.

Coming of age, contortions of a soul, most attempts to realize one’s potential are unimpressive, disgusting, shove my limitations into my face.
While the onset of adulthood ushers aesthetic uniformity and definition into my features, my ego starts resembles a frayed hole-ridden collage, void-exhaling holes.

Life, perpetuation, as i begin to apprehend it at the epilogue of prolonged adolescence: it’s a mystery, it’s a sacrament, but it’s not an eternal climax.
I must now  banish myself from the moment, and forth into the eternal come-up. A realization is being ushered in. I hold vigil over an empty cradle.

What a life. You can almost see the network  -  **god’s face** – cropping up these days.
The blanket of individuality has been worn down and through its holes we, childlike,
 glimpse each other's world, mesmerised, even if only momentarily.
Painfully though it might be, the grimace of human vanity is being effaced. In its place – loom the contours of the face once-more-unaware.

More streets of cobblestone, more winding stairs, more cosmic prairie basking in the night.

*whaddaya mean “What do you want…”? Model affirmation. Minimum error. Maximum signal. I want life and death, but then more life.

Last year and a bit felt absolutely dogged. I'm telling myself i'm a quivering and blooming thing, sprung up from the doldrums of my youth, but every so often a feeling creeps in now: it is those around me who grow just a tad less furiously are the ones to inherit the future and the vision in which i will have already expired. Take care that the blood does not begin to gush too soon.
