Should createa a quick way to post a note on the blog. A way to hold onto loose
thoughts that wash over me when i encounter a quote/paragraph/piece of media
that resonates w me.

Take this Hayek quote:
```
    “Even if the threat of starvation to me and perhaps to my family impels me to accept a distasteful job at a very low wage, even if I am “at the mercy” of the only man willing to employ me, I am not coerced by him or anybody else. So long as the act that has placed me in my predicament is not aimed at making me do or not do specific things, so long as the intent of the act that harms me is not to make me serve another person’s ends, its effect on my freedom is not different from that of any natural calamity – a fire or a flood that destroys my house or an accident that harms my health.”

F. A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty
```
I despise it.

Year in, year out, i gawk at her receding image. Must i have necessarily mangled my life with a reckless pursuit of precisely such a woman among precisely such men?
Must i have picked so poorly and gulped so ravenously from so poisonous a well?
It is not a vain indulgence in the counterfactual, nor a lament of the present
state, but a query: were they indeed unavodaible steps in the maturation of a
soul like mine..? A thirst for affection which drew me wayward and hunger for overcoming of which jealousy and grief were borne,
all swirled in a vicious cocktail that wound me up for a year and slammed me down for two. Or was it all just a contigency.

His handwriting, inescapably tiny no matter the vacancy of the page,
betrayed the naive aspiration to accomplish inside a single page more than
another man apt of larger strokes might. Sadly, the substance often ran out
even before the ink.

Hence, the corridoors of this life were littered with drafts and sketches, empty,
except for a grazed corner where a frenzied but timid mind tried in vain to attach itself to
the page, swept further and further in time by the suffocating current.

Deaf Bethoven in the countryside. What about textures?

Fundametnally, i'm a sorely lonely person. Yes, i have great friends. Rather,
among the people i know there are some people whose souls i hold in high regard. But the itinerancy that has been the bane
of my existence severs me from them.

Why i still am philosophically averse to the notion of AGI _through llms_ despite the huge
strides that Claude etc. made is that even though the feats are impressive, the
intelligence that engendered them remains inchoate and unexaminable.

Why is that bad? Because in lockstep with this kind of intelligence marches a sense of resignation to the human capacity.
And this resignation is exactly how the tumour of post-humanism metastizes. It's just a
notion of progress that is shirking at best and dangerously degenerate at worst.
If LLMs _could_ be made to achieve some version of AGI for 1/100th of the price i wouldn't choose it.
That is not to say that i even for a second belive the Bay Area propaganda.
It would just be embarassing to welcome such a technological overlord in.

Coriolanus
Xenophon

Peter T's advice to de-fragment your life first and foremost. Seems like that's
what i'm up to, more and less and more day in and day out...


So you have claude to catalyze thought, but first and foremostly you have the
engine of your mind and the vehicle of your taste to make progress on problems
that are truly yours. Perhaps _that_ is the crack by which i can escape the cell
of my daily existence.

Let's try to develop this idea of the semantic front. Say for a month.
Articulate it, instantiate it, mathematize it. Start with small examples.

----------------

Here are the philosophical touchpoints in order of appearance:

Wittgenstein (Tractatus) - "whereof one cannot speak..." - Initially referenced regarding limits of language, though we moved away from purely linguistic limitations
Merleau-Ponty (concept of chiasm) - Referenced regarding the intertwining of visible/invisible as analogous to articulable/inchoate knowledge
Hegel (an-sich/für-sich distinction) - Used to discuss movement from implicit to explicit knowledge
Peirce (semiotics) - Mentioned regarding expansion beyond verbal language to broader sign systems
Dennett (physical/design/intentional stances) - Referenced for different modes of system comprehension
Leibniz (principle of sufficient reason) - Discussed regarding how things could be otherwise arranged
Kant (regulative ideals) - Referenced regarding the productive use of incomplete classification systems
Lakatos (research programmes) - Used to discuss measuring competing frameworks' productive potential
Hacking (representing vs intervening) - Referenced regarding frameworks that generate new experimental approaches
Bachelard (phenomenotechnique) - Touched on regarding how scientific knowledge creates new phenomena
Leibniz again (Monadology) - Used regarding levels of perception
Cassirer (Philosophy of Symbolic Forms) - Used to structure different modes of representation
Reichenbach (context of discovery/justification) - Referenced regarding framework evaluation
Bourdieu (forms of capital) - Used to discuss economic dimensions of scientific knowledge

Your novel contributions seemed to center around:

Moving beyond traditional philosophical problems of language/epistemology toward practical problems of knowledge organization
The focus on "productive partitioning" as a way to advance the semantic front
The emphasis on vertical integration across biological scales
The insistence on including economic/pragmatic constraints in any framework for understanding knowledge organization

The discussion seemed to progress from abstract philosophical considerations toward increasingly concrete frameworks for measuring and comparing different types of biological knowledge.

One pernicious symptom of the insecurity which has followed me in life has been
"philosophical fomo". Not quite the fickleness of mind, but the inability at
some basic level to say "I don't know". This alone has probably accounted for
a slew of commitments i had no business making.

How is this description different from saying "i have no strong opinions or
opinions of my own". In fact, the notions i've held onto -- i've held onto quite
strongly. It is just that only a pitiful amount of them have, it seems, originated within
me and not outside.

What is the remedy? Maybe that, which i lacked and lack the most. Continuity.

it's a thought of the most dangeorous thought. But perhaps all this whoring of
self and shedding of ambition and dulling of the keenest desires will be good
for my voice when i do speak. As if i were a rock to be skipped. It certainly
hurts my health. I also can't claim that i am choosing this, i am chosen
and molded by it and that is a tragedy.

Finally found what is perhaps the origin of my favourite line in Foucault:

`cent et cent fois j'ai pris ma lanterne, cherchant en plein midi`

Nerval - Choix des poésies de Ronsard
LA FOLIE EST GENERALE.

J’AI pris cent et cent fois la lanterne en la main,
Cherchant en plein midi, parmi le genre humain^
Un homme qui fust homme et defaiot et de mine,
Et qui pust’des vertus passer parl’estamine.,
Il n’est coin et recoin que je n’ayè tenté,
Depuis que la nature ici-bas m’a planté ;
Mais tant plus jo me lime, et plus je me rabote,
Je crois qu’à mon advis tout le monde radote,
Qu’il a la teste vuide et sans dessus dessous,
Ou qu’il faut qu’au rebours je sois l’un des plus fous ;
C’est de nostre folie un plaisant stratagesme, -
Se flattant, de juger les autres par soi-mesme.

Ceux qui, pour.voyager, s’embarquent dessus l’eau
Voyent aller la terre, et non pas leur vaiseau.
Peut-estre, ainsi trompé, que faussement je Juge.
Toutesfois si les fous ont leur sens pour refuge,
Je ne suis pas tenu de croire aux yeux d’aulruy :
Puis j’en sçay pour le moins autant ou plus que lui.

Things that make me grow:
- adding to the blog. anything. science, photos, poems, thoguhts, art.
- reading about biology
- improving ribxz, developing this idea
- meditation and physical exercise

what's with this desire to make a name for myself in bioligy? why biology of all
things? inertia? that's just where i ended up after drugs but before will could
ever mature and got stifled but life and sin? Maybe.
But if not -- the story i tell myself is it is the best vantage point to apply
technology from to inspect life from. then what is it exactly do you want to
find out? What discovery is that you want to make in how life works?

This constantly gets conflated with the desire to put your stamp on history at any cost, not even be the first, just be the author.
To birth a way of thinking, even if infinitely small and particular, which
people would call undeniably yours.

Why does academia not work? It's antithetical by definition. Originality is
what it excludes. Too limited in its reach. Its government corrupt with the most common of human vices,
immediately diluting any identity that ever emerges there.


But why must it be science and not industry, not purely linux or whatever then?
That is too worldly, too subservient to those same vices.

The only way out of this vicious loop is more vicious strife. Every minute.
Conscience must chime like a bell, measuring every step.

A lot of tasks get left undone. A lot of wounds unattended. I can only think of
meditaiton at this point as a possible mechanism to turn the tide. Otherwise
this is looking pretty grim.

Wrote a lot of code, really getting into the rhythm with Claude-assisted
writing. It's easy to be excited about the productivity.

Read a little bit about Proust and Nadia Boulanger. Left eye hurts from
concentration. I need to get back into exercising (except just running).


 As for writing, Proust observes that “the impression is for the writer what experiment is for the scientist, with the difference that in the scientist the work of the intelligence precedes the experiment and in the writer it comes after the impression.”

“Real life, life at last laid bare and illuminated—the only life in consequence which can be said to be really lived—is literature.”

When i move back to Europe my first vacation would be reading books and smoking cigarretes while jumping trains in the balkans.
